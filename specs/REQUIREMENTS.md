## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the AI Cloud Document Vault — a cloud-based application that allows users to digitise, organise, and intelligently query physical documents (manuals, warranties, guides) using AI.

### 1.2 Scope

The system will provide:
- Document capture via camera or file upload
- AI-powered OCR and text extraction
- Intelligent auto-categorisation
- Full-text and semantic search
- Natural language Q&A over stored documents
- Cloud synchronisation across devices

### 1.3 Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| OCR | Optical Character Recognition — extracting text from images |
| RAG | Retrieval-Augmented Generation — answering questions using retrieved document context |
| Embedding | A numerical vector representation of text for similarity comparison |
| Chunk | A segment of a document (~500 tokens) stored for retrieval |

## 6. Assumptions

1. Users have a smartphone with a camera capable of taking readable photos of documents
2. Documents are primarily in English (multi-language is stretch goal)
3. Documents are printed text (handwriting recognition is out of scope for MVP)
4. Users have internet connectivity for initial upload (offline access is read-only)
5. AWS services used will remain available and within free-tier/budget limits

## 7. Acceptance Criteria Summary

| Feature | Acceptance Criteria |
|---------|-------------------|
| Document capture | User can photograph a document and see it stored within 30 seconds |
