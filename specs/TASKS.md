## 4. Risk Register

| ID | Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Contingency |
|----|------|-------------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| R1 | OCR accuracy too low on phone photos | Medium | High | Image pre-processing pipeline; camera overlay guide | Allow manual text correction; use higher-quality Textract mode |
| R2 | OpenAI API costs exceed budget | Medium | Medium | Use GPT-4o-mini (cheapest), cache responses, use Ollama locally | Switch to fully local model (Ollama + Llama 3) for all environments |
| R3 | Scope creep — too many features | High | High | Strict MoSCoW prioritisation; "Could Have" items are future work | Cut mobile app, focus on web only |
| R4 | React Native too complex / slow to develop | Medium | Medium | Start with web app (higher priority); mobile is stretch goal | Drop mobile app; demonstrate responsive web app on phone instead |
| R5 | AWS free tier exceeded | Medium | Low | Set billing alarms at €10, €25, €50; tear down dev env when not in use | Switch to cheaper services or local-only demo |
| R6 | RAG answers are inaccurate / hallucinate | Medium | High | Strict prompt engineering; "I don't know" fallback; show source chunks for verification | Reduce scope to search-only (no generative answers) |
| R7 | Textract not available in chosen region | Low | Medium | Check region availability early; use eu-west-1 (Ireland) | Use Tesseract as primary OCR engine |
| R8 | Time lost to debugging infrastructure | Medium | Medium | Use Docker Compose for most development; only deploy to AWS for integration testing | Simplify infra (skip ECS, deploy to single EC2 instance) |
| R9 | Database performance with vector search | Low | Medium | Index tuning; limit vector dimensions; use IVFFlat index | Reduce chunk count per document; use external vector DB |
| R10 | Burnout / time management | Medium | High | Consistent schedule; 2-week sprints with clear goals; no weekend work unless behind | De-scope to MVP; move extras to "future work" section of report |

## 5. Definition of Done

A task is **done** when:

1. Code is written and follows project style guidelines
2. Unit tests pass (where applicable)
3. Code is committed to a feature branch
4. PR is created with description of changes
5. CI pipeline passes (tests + lint)
6. Merged to main branch
7. Deployed to dev environment (for backend/infra tasks)
8. Documented (API docs updated, README if needed)

---

## 6. Tools & Project Management

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| GitHub Issues | Task tracking (labels: phase, priority, type) |
| GitHub Projects (Kanban board) | Sprint board (To Do, In Progress, Done) |
| GitHub Actions | CI/CD |
| GitHub Wiki or `docs/` folder | Design decisions, meeting notes |

## 7. Estimated Total Effort

| Phase | Hours |
|-------|-------|
| Phase 1: Foundation | 64 |
| Phase 2: Core Backend | 54 |
| Phase 3: AI Features | 66 |
| Phase 4: Frontend | 82 |
| Phase 5: Polish | 26 |
| Phase 6: Testing | 50 |
| Phase 7: Documentation | 66 |
| **Total** | **408** |

At ~17 hours/week over 24 weeks = 408 hours. This is realistic for a final year project alongside other modules.
